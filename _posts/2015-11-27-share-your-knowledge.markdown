For a software engineer, the industry right now is in a very exciting time. There are so many
oppotunities to make mearningful impact and learning new skills has become so much easier, thanks to
countless available resources on the internet. 

However, any successful software services or apps have so many moving parts 
that no single engineer can know every corner of codebase and
the intricacies of technologies being used. 

I strongly believe sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to scale your
engineering organization. Great engineers want to learn as much and as
effectively as possible, and learning from your teammates achieves that. Not
only that, teaching is also a very effective way to learn as you need to know
your material well before you teach someone else.

At Nextdoor, we have a concept called "Share Your Knowledge" which I desribe it
full in details here on the
[blog](https://engblog.nextdoor.com/2015/06/03/share-your-knowledge/). Please
