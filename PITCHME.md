# My operating values

---

## Enabling a highly effective team

Whole is greater than the sum of parts

Technology and product change, but people don't change as much

---

## 1. Trust

- 1:1
- Communication channel
- Team activities

---

### 1:1

<!--
- Weekly session for ~30 minutes
- Happiness index as a conversation starter
- Focus on listening
- Provide and receive fresh feedback
- Agree on action items on both ends for the next time
-->

Create a safe space for your direct report to openly discuss their thoughts

---

### Communication channel

- Responsible as the primary communication channel
- Provide right context to the new information for your team
- Represent your team by externally communicating team status, issues, and achievements 

---

### Team activities

<!--
- Weekly team boba run
- Dinner / Movies night out
- offsites
-->

Encourage your teammates to get to know each other and create team identity. This leads to deeper team rapport and trust

---

## 2. Shared learnings and experiences

---

### "Share your knowledge" and co-ops

<!--
- "Share your knowledge": Eng all hands presentation to the entire eng org
- Co-ops: Bi-weeky cross team technical meetings about iOS and Android
-->

Promote inter-team learnings and help improve presentation and communication skills

---

### Eng blog

<!--

-->

Promote external presence of the engineering team and lead to more inbound engineering candidates 

---

## 3. Small Wins

---

- Enable team to feel progress and keep the momentum
- Avoid feature creeps or imaginary problems
- Collect relevant data as early as possible 
- Celebrating small wins are underrated

---

# Hard lessons

---

### 1. Decision making

- Wrong decision is better than indecision
- Co-owning the result of the decision, especially when the outcome was not as expected, fosters deeper team trust 

---

### 2. Autonomy + Accountability = Ownership

- Set clear goals and expectations for the team
- Allow the team to make appropriate decisions and drive it to the end
- Install the sense of ownership in the success of projects

---

### 3. Just the right amount of processes

---

### PlanGrid

Consumer -> Enterprise

Solving current real world problems 

Been on my radar since 2016
