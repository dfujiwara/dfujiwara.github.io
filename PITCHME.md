The whole is greater than the sum of its parts

Technology and product change, but people don't change as much

---

## Highly effective team

- Collaboration
- Autonomy + accountability
- Trust

### 1. Collaboration

- Knowledge share sessions 
- Share ideas early on instead of finished products
- Blogs and meetups

Create a space to learn from and teach to each other for better outcome

### 2. Autonomy + accountability

- "What do you think?" 
- "Can you go figure it out and get back to me?"
- Mentorship opportunities

Create a space for creativity and responsibility beyond one's own work

---

### 3. Trust

- 1:1
- Team activities

Create a safe space for your direct reports to openly discuss their thoughts and establish team identity

Not easy, but it's such a rewarding experience
